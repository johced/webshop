# Welcome to our first webshop!

Our task is to create some simple functionallity for a basic webshop using jQuery.

## Functionality

- Product page (X items)
- Place in shoppingcart
- Change amount of products in shoppingcart, delete items.
- Checkout -> Confirmation with user being able to once again change amount of items or delete items before processing buy.
- Order -> Just some simple popup or other functionallity to let user know the order been successful.

# Installation

## jQueryUI

- Go to jqueryui.com
- Quick download: Stable (v1.12.1)
- Unzip the file in the folder

## Gulp

- npm i gulp
- npm i gulp-sass
- npm i gulp-csso
- npm i gulp-rename

**After successful installation**

In terminal: gulp

Now you have successfully installed gulp and its updating css automatically.

## Important

Only change the .scss files, NEVER the CSS file.
Never change the listnames and class in main.js without doing it together in the team.
How we work with branches: create a new branch called feature/functionName.
